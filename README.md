## Regularization:

| L2 | L1 |
| --- | --- |
| penalizes higher value of weights and tries to center it towards zero | Reduce Features |

## Regression Algorithms:

| Linear | Ridge | Lasso |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Without Regularization | L2 | L1 |

## Classification:

* Precision(P): True Positive / Predicted Positive 
* Recall(R) / Sensitivity: True Positive / Actual Positive
* F1 Score : 1/F1 = 1/2(1/P + 1/R) , If P or R is having low value it will make sure overall score is lower

| Logistic Regression | LinearSVM |

| Supports All types of Classification | Binary |
| Has L1/L2 Regularization | |
